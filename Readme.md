# AI-Social-Distancing-with-Mask-Detecion
This is a Social Distancing Project where you can measure distance between two faces and also check whether they're wearing masks or not. 
OpenCV is used here for Image Recognition
Haar Cascade classifier and mobilenetV2 Model is also used here 
Scipy is used to measure distance between two faces


For this project you'll need the following dependencies:
1. TensorFlow
2. Numpy
3. imutils
4. scipy
5. OpenCV
6. pyttsx3


### Executing Program:
Open a terminal in the project folder and run the following commands:
* to install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* run Main.py
```
python3 Main.py
```
